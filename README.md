# M07AssessmentHolidays
Martin Luther King Day, Presidents Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, May Day, Independence Day for multiple cultures, International Talk Like a Pirate Day... these are just some of the many holidays out there.  You will be designing a text-based application to track holidays.

This is a terminal-based holiday manager. There is a starting JSON file, holidays.json, that must be used with the holiday_manager.py file. Web-scraping is done at the "https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/" site. 625 holidays should load. 

At this time, the weather API is incomplete as well as viewing holidays within a particular year/week.
